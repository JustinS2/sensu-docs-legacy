# Sensu Enterprise

Sensu Enterprise builds on Sensu Core by providing added value in the form of several opinionated extensions, along with enterprise class support. We like to think of the distinction between Sensu Core and Sensu Enterprise as the difference between a framework and a product. The purpose of this documentation is to help Sensu Enterprise users configure their installation, making use of the many third-party integrations and features Sensu Enterprise has to offer. Sensu Enterprise integrates with third-party tools & services to provide support for creating/resolving incidents, on-call rotation scheduling, storing time series data (metrics), relaying events, deregistering sensu-clients for terminated nodes, and/or notifying contacts via various media.

## Objectives
