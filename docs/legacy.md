# Legacy Documentation

Documentation for Sensu versions **up to 0.23** is no longer being hosted on the
Sensu website. Unless you are looking for legacy Sensu documentation on purpose,
please refer to the documentation for the [latest release][1]. To access legacy
Sensu documentation, please visit the [sensu-docs][2] project on GitHub.
